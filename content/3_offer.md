# Straightforward support for the hardest chapters.

Every loss is different, but the need for honesty is the same.

How I help:

- End-of-life planning and grounded guidance
- Support for families and loved ones before and after loss
- Creating personal, meaningful rituals — no rules, no formality
- Grief support that’s direct, human, and judgment-free
