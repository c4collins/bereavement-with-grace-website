## Every loss is different, but the need for honesty is the&nbsp;same.

#### How I help:

- ###### End-of-life planning and grounded&nbsp;guidance
- ###### Support for families and loved ones before and after&nbsp;loss
- ###### Creating personal, meaningful rituals — no rules, no&nbsp;formality
- ###### Grief support that’s direct, human, and&nbsp;judgment-free
