# When you’re ready to talk, I’m here.

There’s no perfect time to reach out.

If you’re navigating loss — or know you will be — we can start with a simple conversation.

***

## Services & Pricing

Death and grief can be disorienting. I help handle what feels too heavy — both the emotional parts and the practical details — with calm, clarity, and respect.

## End-of-Life Support

Guidance and grounded presence before and during death.

This work starts while someone is still here. It’s about easing the overwhelm and making sure things unfold the way they’re meant to — with intention, not chaos.

- **$120/hour** — virtual or in-person (within local area)
- **Half-day support (3 hours): $325**
- **Full-day bedside presence (6 hours): $600**

Includes:

- Emotional and practical guidance for individuals and families
- Contacting funeral homes, coordinating logistics, and handling details most people don’t want to manage alone
- Helping organize final wishes, paperwork, or memorial planning
- Bedside presence and support for both the dying and their loved ones
- Follow-up resources and check-ins after each visit

## Bereavement Support

Emotional and practical support after loss.

Once the services are over and life feels strangely quiet, that’s where this work continues.

I offer a space to process, breathe, and start finding steady ground again — without any pressure to “move on.”

- **$100/hour** — virtual or in-person
- **4-session package: $350** (recommended for ongoing support)

Includes:

- One-on-one grief sessions and emotional check-ins
- Guidance through immediate post-loss tasks or decisions
- Honest conversations about what’s changed and what comes next
- Tools to help you rebuild at your own pace

## Legacy & Ritual Creation

Finding meaning in memory.

Some people want to leave something behind. Others want to honour someone who’s gone.

This is about creating moments or keepsakes that feel authentic — not forced or ceremonial.

- **Starting at $200**

May include:

- Writing letters, recording memories, or creative storytelling
- Designing personal rituals or simple memorials
- Optional collaboration on memorial photography or keepsake pieces
