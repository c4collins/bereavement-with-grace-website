# When you’re ready to talk, I’m&nbsp;here.

There’s no perfect time to reach&nbsp;out.

If you’re navigating loss — or know you will be — we can start with a simple&nbsp;conversation.

## Services Offered

Death and grief can be disorienting. I help handle what feels too heavy — both the emotional parts and the practical details — with calm, clarity, and&nbsp;respect.

## End-of-Life Support

Guidance and grounded presence before and during&nbsp;death.

This work starts while someone is still here. It’s about easing the overwhelm and making sure things unfold the way they’re meant to — with intention, not&nbsp;chaos.

Includes:

- Emotional and practical guidance for individuals and&nbsp;families
- Contacting funeral homes, coordinating logistics, and handling details most people don’t want to manage&nbsp;alone
- Helping organize final wishes, paperwork, or memorial&nbsp;planning
- Bedside presence and support for both the dying and their loved&nbsp;ones
- Follow-up resources and check-ins after each&nbsp;visit

## Bereavement Support

Emotional and practical support after&nbsp;loss.

Once the services are over and life feels strangely quiet, that’s where this work&nbsp;continues.

I offer a space to process, breathe, and start finding steady ground again — without any pressure to&nbsp;“move&nbsp;on.”

Includes:

- One-on-one grief sessions and emotional check&#8209;ins
- Guidance through immediate post-loss tasks or&nbsp;decisions
- Honest conversations about what’s changed and what comes&nbsp;next
- Tools to help you rebuild at your own&nbsp;pace

## Legacy & Ritual&nbsp;Creation

Finding meaning in&nbsp;memory.

Some people want to leave something behind. Others want to honour someone who’s&nbsp;gone.

This is about creating moments or keepsakes that feel authentic — not forced or&nbsp;ceremonial.

May include:

- Writing letters, recording memories, or creative&nbsp;storytelling
- Designing personal rituals or simple&nbsp;memorials
- Optional collaboration on memorial photography or keepsake&nbsp;pieces
