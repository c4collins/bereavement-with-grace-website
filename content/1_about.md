# Grounded support from someone who’s seen both sides of loss.

I’ve worked within two funeral homes as a Funeral Director Assistant, supporting families through every stage of loss — from first contact to final arrangements.

That experience taught me what most people never see: how heavy this process can be, and how often compassion gets lost in the logistics.

I started Bereavement with Grace to change that.

This isn’t about sterile professionalism or scripted comfort. It’s about real support — practical, emotional, and human — for the moments that don’t fit neatly into a brochure.

I bring a background in funeral service, emotional support work, and grounded presence to help people navigate both the planning and the aftermath of loss with honesty and calm.
