# Real support for real loss.

No two experiences of death or grief look the same — so what I offer depends on what you need.

Sometimes that’s structure. Sometimes it’s someone who gets it.

Either way, it’s honest, steady, and human.

***

## End-of-Life Support

- Guidance for individuals and families as they prepare for death
- Helping you talk through choices, wishes, and practical steps
- Support in planning vigils, farewells, or personal rituals
- Sitting bedside to hold calm, grounded space

***

## Bereavement Support

- One-on-one grief sessions (in person or virtual)
- Space to process emotions and uncertainty — without judgment or “shoulds”
- Tools for navigating daily life after loss
- Check-ins and continued support when everyone else fades away

***

## Legacy & Ritual

- Helping capture stories, letters, or creative expressions of remembrance
- Designing rituals that feel authentic — not forced or formal
- Memorial photography, writing, or keepsake creation (optional add-ons)
