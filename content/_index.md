# Loss changes everything.
## Let’s not pretend it doesn’t.

Grief isn’t tidy, poetic, or linear. It’s messy. It’s quiet one minute and unbearable the next.

Bereavement with Grace exists to make space for all of it — the real parts no one talks about.

I help people move through death and loss with honesty and steadiness. No scripts. No forced positivity. Just grounded support when things get heavy.
