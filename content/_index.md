# Loss changes everything.
## Let’s not pretend it&nbsp;doesn’t.

Grief isn’t tidy, poetic, or linear. It’s messy. It’s quiet one minute and unbearable the&nbsp;next.

Bereavement&nbsp;with&nbsp;Grace exists to make space for all of it — the real parts no one talks&nbsp;about.

I help people move through death and loss with honesty and steadiness. No scripts. No forced positivity. Just grounded support when things get&nbsp;heavy.

# Grief isn’t something to fix. It’s something to&nbsp;face.

###### There’s a lot of noise around how we “should”&nbsp;grieve.

#### Ignore&nbsp;it.

###### This work is about presence — sitting with the discomfort, naming what’s real, and finding small ways to stay connected to life when it feels like it’s&nbsp;slipping.

##### It’s not about moving on. It’s about moving&nbsp;with.
