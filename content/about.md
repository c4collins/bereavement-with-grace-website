# Grounded support from someone who’s seen both sides of&nbsp;loss.

###### I’ve worked within two funeral homes as a Funeral&nbsp;Director&nbsp;Assistant, supporting families through every stage of loss — from first contact to final&nbsp;arrangements.

###### That experience taught me what most people never see: how heavy this process can be, and how often compassion gets lost in the&nbsp;logistics.

###### I started Bereavement with Grace to change&nbsp;that.

###### This isn’t about sterile professionalism or scripted comfort. It’s about real support — practical, emotional, and human — for the moments that don’t fit neatly into a&nbsp;brochure.

###### I bring a background in funeral service, emotional support work, and grounded presence to help people navigate both the planning and the aftermath of loss with honesty and&nbsp;calm.
